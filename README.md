ABOUT THIS PROJECT: This app will let you add books to create a customed List.

THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND: As of Know this App data comes through a local server so you need to start it up.
Run this commands on the directory:
json-server --watch db.json -port 8000. Keep in mind that if you do not specify the port this could cause issues since by default  React and json server run on the same port(3000) so DO choose 8000 port for the json server since the fetch requests are pointing to this port.
